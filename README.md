# Selenium Testing Project

## Overview

This project is designed to showcase proficiency in Selenium acceptance testing, incorporating practices of Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) with pytest. The primary goal is to demonstrate the ability to write effective test suites using Selenium, structured around the Page Object Model (POM) for maintainability and readability.


## Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `/pages`: Contains Page Object models representing sections of the web application.
- `/tests`: Contains pytest test files.
- `.github/workflows`: Contains GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow definitions.

## CI/CD

This project uses GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). Upon every push to the repository, GitHub Actions automatically runs the test suites, ensuring that changes do not break existing functionality.
